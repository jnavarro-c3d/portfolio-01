# portfolio-01
First attempt at creating an online portfolio.

This was created using primarily HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap 4 framework. Lots of front-end practice. Good practice, good practice.

Obviously, this is the very first screenshot placed inside the readme. I figured that this would be a good way to keep track of my project progress as time goes on. Here, you can see all of the work that I put into the very front of the page. Using Joker as the central image, not bad, hehe. (For anyone who may be viewing this, I did not draw this; Joker is a character that belongs to Atlus and is from the JRPG Persona 5.)
